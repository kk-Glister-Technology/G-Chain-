# 🌐 Gloxx Chain Node

Welcome to the official **Gloxx Chain Node**, the core engine powering the decentralized Gloxx blockchain.

This node is written in **Rust** for performance and safety. It is **open-source**, **under active development**, and intended to be run by anyone — independently or as part of a wider network.

---

## 🛠 Project Status

This project is **under construction**. Not all components are complete. Expect breaking changes as we implement:

- Consensus (PoW or PoS)
- Peer-to-peer networking
- JSON-RPC / WebSocket APIs
- Wallet & mining support

You're welcome to explore, contribute, and run it locally.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

This project uses:

- **Rust** (performance, safety, low-level control)
- `tokio` for async networking
- `clap` for CLI argument parsing
- `serde` and `bincode` for data encoding
- `libp2p` (planned) for decentralized networking
- `rocksdb` or `sled` (to be decided) for state storage
- Cryptography: Ed25519 or Secp256k1 for wallet signing

| Tools      | Git, curl     | Git, curl, cargo|

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Rust**

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh.             


2. **Clone the Repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gloxxchain/gloxx-node.git
   cd gloxx-node


3. **Build the Node**


   ```bash
   cargo build --release

4. **Run in Dev Mode**

   ```bash
   ./target/release/gloxx-node run --dev

---


🧮 CLI Usage

**Use --help to explore commands:**

   ```bash
   gloxx-node --help
```

Example full command:

   ```bash
   gloxx-node run --port 40333 --data-dir .gloxxdata --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/40333
```

---

🛰 *How This Node Stays Decentralized*


Anyone can clone, build, and run the exact same code independently.

```
Nodes connect peer-to-peer.
```

---

🧑‍💻 *Useful Development Commands*

   ```bash
   # Format code
   cargo fmt
```
---

   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   cargo test
```
---

   ```bash
   # Check for compile errors
   cargo check
```

---

🔌 (Planned) JSON-RPC Format

   ```json
   POST /rpc
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "method": "get_balance",
     "params": ["0xUSERADDRESS"],
     "id": 1
   }
```
---

Other RPC methods (coming soon): send_tx, get_block, get_tx, subscribe, etc.
