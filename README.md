# 🌐 Gloxx Chain Node

Welcome to the official **Gloxx Chain Node**, the core engine powering the decentralized Gloxx blockchain.

This node is written in **Rust** for performance and safety. It is **open-source**, **under active development**, and intended to be run by anyone — independently or as part of a wider network.

---

## 🛠 Project Status

This project is **under construction**. Not all components are complete. Expect breaking changes as we implement:

- Consensus (PoW or PoS)
- Peer-to-peer networking
- JSON-RPC / WebSocket APIs
- Wallet & mining support

You're welcome to explore, contribute, and run it locally.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

This project uses:

- **Rust** (performance, safety, low-level control)
- `tokio` for async networking
- `clap` for CLI argument parsing
- `serde` and `bincode` for data encoding
- `libp2p` (planned) for decentralized networking
- `rocksdb` or `sled` (to be decided) for state storage
- Cryptography: Ed25519 or Secp256k1 for wallet signing

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Rust**
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

2. Clone the Repo



git clone https://github.com/gloxxchain/gloxx-node.git
cd gloxx-node

3. Build the Node



cargo build --release

4. Run in Dev Mode



./target/release/gloxx-node run --dev


---

🧮 CLI Usage

Use --help to explore commands:

gloxx-node --help

Example full command:

gloxx-node run --port 40333 --data-dir ./gloxxdata --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/40333

🛰 How This Node Stays Decentralized

Although you can host this node on a VPS, the project is decentralized because:

Anyone can clone, build, and run the exact same code independently.

Nodes connect peer-to-peer, not through centralized APIs.

No node depends on a central VPS unless you explicitly configure it.

Users run their own RPC endpoints locally.


If you deploy on a VPS, that’s just one instance. Real decentralization comes when many people run nodes around the world.

🧑‍💻 Useful Development Commands

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Check for compile errors
cargo check


---

🔌 (Planned) JSON-RPC Format

POST /rpc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "get_balance",
  "params": ["0xUSERADDRESS"],
  "id": 1
}

Other RPC methods (coming soon): send_tx, get_block, get_tx, subscribe, etc.
